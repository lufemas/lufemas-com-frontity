A project to try out [Frontity](https://frontity.org/).

It's a React based framework that makes really simple the  Wordpress REST API integration.

The reason why I got interested in Frontity is that it uses server side rendering with is great for SEO against the React single page application.

With Frontity I can deploy the project to Vercel, and I think I can get very good results.
